                            <p>I love Mike, coffee, running, and taking pictures, in that order.
                                I drink iced coffee black, year round, regardless of the temperature outside.  
                                I have completed six half-marathons, soon to be seven.  
                                I have also ran countless 5k road races and obstacle races (uphill on a ski mountain!) 
                                and I have even convinced Mike to join me on these adventures.  
                                I love taking pictures and instagram (<a href='http://instagram.com/kk021'>@kk021</a>) is one of my favorite hobbies.
                            </p>
                            <p>By day, I am a Human Resources Partner at one of the leading drug development companies in the world.  
                                My days are a combination of management, legal, finance and psychology.  
                                For the past two years I have spent my evenings after work attending graduate school to pursue my 
                                Masters in Business Administration (MBA).  I love reading the Wall Street Journal, almost as much 
                                as I love playing video games like Call of Duty with Mike and our ushers below.

                            <h4>Mike Rahaim</h4>
                            <p>I'm not sure if I'm an extraverted introvert or an introverted extravert, but I always tend to look for the best of both worlds...
                                or the best of each world? Let's just say I'm always looking to optimize in N dimensions. Even my research relates to hybrid heterogeneous systems.
                                I spent a long time looking for the perfect person - someone perfect in every way - and I found her in Kori. So much so that she convinced 
                                me to run races and occasionally watch shows like the Millionaire Matchmaker.
                            </p>
                            <p>On any given day, you could find me sitting in a lab, searching for the closest blackjack table, or lugging Christmas trees
                                (I guess that only applies for any given day from November to January). I love learning, teaching, Madden, and Oxford commas.
                                Every day is better than the day before, smiling is my favorite, and I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up.

                        <p>The ladies who will stand by my side are the dearest friends I have had the privilege of having in my life.  
                            Please note: We will also refer to them as “Bridesbabes” from here on, because

                                    I have an open heart and an open mind!  People say I have a cheerful disposition. 
                                    I am an old soul and feel that I could happily exist in another era. 
                                    I love animals and you will never catch me wearing real fur. 
                                    I work in an Emergency Room and love it!  I am passionate and still have many goals I would like to accomplish. 
                                    Kori and Mike are awesome and I am so grateful to be a part of their special day!  :)

                                    We are both adopted and awesome.  I have an adorably cute dog named Annie. She looks like a muppet.  
                                    I have completed two marathons and 5 half marathons. I might have an obsession with going to Disney World.  
                                    I can't whistle.  I love the color green.  I make a mean mushroom risotto and I'm a pretty decent

                                <p>I grew up in Lynnfield, Massachusetts with my parents and two younger brothers. 
                                    I went to college to pursue my passion in Art. During my freshman year at Merrimack College is when I met one of my best friends, Kori. 
                                    After College, I went on get my Masters in Art Education at Salem State. 
                                    I recently purchased my first home in Reading, Massachusetts and landed my dream job, teaching Art at the Lynnfield Middle School. 
                                    I am so excited to be part of my best friend’s wedding in September! :)

                                <p>About me: I am Sarah Mills.  I am a woman of many names.  I currently reside in San Francisco where I have been for 6+ years.  
                                    My favorite hobbies are riding my bike around the city, running, going to the dog park and pretending all the puppies are mine, and writing snail mail.  
                                    I do not like peaches or string beans and my favorite candy is Haribo gummy bears.  I also enjoy body modification, fro-yo, and long hash tags.
                                </p>
                                <p>About us:  Smills and KK met at Merrimack College in 2003.  We spent the next 4 years living together (or in close proximity), 
                                    eating questionable food from the cafeteria (is this salad safe?), getting our learn on 
                                    (no, seriously - we both graduated with good grades and more than one degree each).  
                                    We enjoyed classes together such as Philosophy and Photography, and excelled at team sports such as indoor netless ping pong and flip ... never mind.  
                                    We went in a bit of a different direction immediately after college, but were able to find each other and reconnect (even with 3,000 miles between us).  
                                    Since then we have been able to visit each other on both coasts where we enjoyed celebrations, wine tasting, ferry riding on the bay, the happiest of hours, 
                                    plays, 5 year college reunions, impromptu paint nights, and trips to NH just like old times.  Distance is hard, but having a friend like Kori who is always 
                                    willing to stay connected is a true gift.  I am thrilled to be a part of your big day. 
                                </p>
                                <p>About him: I got to hear ALL about Mike from Kori while they first started their dating journey and I was very excited at the news that he would be 
                                    visiting SF with Kori last year.  I knew I didn't have much time with them, so I made sure to put him to work to make sure he made the cut!  
                                    After bike riding all over San Francisco and surviving a night of heel clicking and sloppy swishing I nodded my head in approval.  He's a keeper.  
                                    I am happy we have been able to spend more time together since then, and I am so excited for this year!  In a recent visit to Boston where I stayed 
                                    with Kori and Mike it was so very obvious to me that they were meant to be.  No particular reason to call out - you just spend time with them and 
                                    can feel it.  Congrats you two!

                                    one" (sorry Mike, she was "the one" for me first!). She was not only a great roommate, but an even better friend. She was the most easy-going, 
                                    thoughtful person I had lived with, and I always valued her career advice since she was a few years ahead of me in the world of HR. I remember 
                                    the first date she had with Mike and I basically dragged every detail out of her (as I tend to do with most of my friends). As I watched their 
                                    relationship develop, I remember thinking that there was something just so easy and natural about it - no games, no tricks - just something 
                                    refreshingly real. As I got to know Mike, I realized how much his selfless, genuine personality complemented Kori's so well. There was not a 
                                    doubt in my mind that they would end up together, and I don't think I've ever felt so happy about another couple.
                                </p>
                                <p>A few years later when Kori told me she was moving out to live with Mike, I was beyond thrilled for them (ok, a part of me was pretty sad, 
                                    knowing I would lose Kori as a roommate), but I knew this would be an exciting next chapter in her life. I feel so fortunate to have met the 
                                    both of them, and I'm honored to be a part of their special day. I wish them all of the happiness in the world, and I don't think there are 
                                    two other people that deserve it more. Love you Kori and Mike!

                                <p>Hi, my name is Brian Morrissette. I will be turning 30 this April and I will be marrying
                                    my beautiful fiancée Bethany LeBorious on May 9th of this year. We have a 4 year old son 
                                    Brandon who is Mike’s godson. I work for Hamilton Sundstrand (now UTAS) and I have been 
                                    there for about 7 years as a manufacturing control person in the Space Systems business. 
                                    I have known Mike for twenty years and we became friends in scouts. A few years later I 
                                    started working for Mike’s dad doing Christmas trees and then for the electrical wholesaling 
                                    side of the business. I have a lot of great memories of my times with Mike. School vacation
                                    at the Ramada, waterskiing (or at least trying…it’s more like submarining for me), Mike
                                    locking his keys in his car in Canada, Canada trips, Fourth of July parties, and of course
                                    all of the camping trips both in and outside of scouts. I have a lot of great memories with
                                    Mike and I know that there are many more to come.

                                <p>Hello, my name is Chris. Mike and I have been hanging out, selling Christmas trees, making fun of each other, 
                                    and avoiding growing up since we met in the 2nd grade. I got married to my beautiful wife Casey back in 2010 
                                    and Mike was the best man at our wedding. He gave a great speech and an even better bachelor party. 
                                    I have a daughter named Hailey who will be two this coming April, and has quickly become the 2nd love of my life. 
                                    I graduated from MCLA in 2007 and currently work at Farm Credit Financial Partners as a Business Analyst.  
                                    I worked for Mike’s father throughout high school, and we referred to ourselves as Object Relocation Engineers. 
                                    For my final thought, I would like to remember a trip I to Montreal with Mike and some other friends. 
                                    We had a great time and did not want to end the trip and start the seven hour ride home. Mike, being the wonderful 
                                    and thoughtful friend that he is, locked his keys in the car (with it running) and we got to hang out for an extra 
                                    three hours. Mike continually puts his friends and family before himself, and he always knows how to keep life interesting.

                                <p>Hey everyone! I just recently turned the big 30.  During my early to mid twenties, I was an EMT 
                                    for a private ambulance company in Springfield, Ma.  A few years ago I decided to go back to school 
                                    full time and pursue a degree in psychology.  My ultimate career goal is to be a substance abuse 
                                    counselor.  Mike and I grew up together and we have had a great friendship for the last 15 years or so. 
                                    He is one of the most honest, down to earth, and brilliant people that I know.  We have shared a lot 
                                    of memories over the years.  From the yearly 4th of July parties and camping trips, to the countless 
                                    casino and Las Vegas trips. We have always found a way to make things fun.  From the first time I met
                                    Kori, I knew almost instantly that Mike had found someone that complemented his personality so well. 
                                    Kori's great sense of humor and wit always finds a way to make the people around her smile. Together, 
                                    Mike and Kori are both awesome people and make an amazing couple.

                                <p>Mike and I have been friends since freshman year at RPI where our friendship grew 
                                    over the mutual failure (i.e., lack of interest) at the Calc 2 gateway exam and our decision to play WWE 
                                    instead of studying for the final. The video gaming trend continued on throughout RPI as 
                                    we were 2 of the 9 roommates at the 2227 house. I have gone to Vegas and casino's with
                                    Mike on many occasions. Honestly though, I'll do just about anything if it involves
                                    copious amounts of booze (and my gambling luck is some of the worst ever seen so I 
                                    don't go to win). I spent a better part of a decade living in the City of Dreams 
                                    (aka Troy, NY) but for the last 3 years I've been living in Chicago.

                                    for the nuptials of Kori and Mike.  From my humble beginnings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
                                    I met Kori and Mike in February 2013 when I became one of Kori's roommates without having met her.  
                                    I'm an eternal optimist who lives and dies by two mantras: "If you can dream it, you can do it!" 
                                    and "Don't hate me cause you ain't me."  I love being Kori's friend because she laughs at all of 
                                    my jokes and constantly provides me with new ones.  We also connect on our love for smiling, 
                                    laughing, and musical interests that include Taylor Swift, Celine Dion, and Disney songs.  
                                    Not to be outdone by Kori, Mike and I have a strong connection thanks to our nerdy love for all 
                                    things mathematical, scientific, and board game related.  I couldn't be happier for these two 
                                    lovebirds and am excited to continue to force myself into their relationship whether they like it or not!

                                <p>My name is Zack, the second of two Zac(k)s who will be ushering at the wedding.  
                                    You can call me Wolf to avoid confusion.  I first met Kori and Mike when I moved in as one of Kori's roommates, 
                                    it took a while as I am shy (the opposite of Zac) but once it was started, the friendship was cemented.  
                                    From there I met Mike where we bonded over our shared nerdy-ness.  However it doesn't make sense to talk of 
                                    them separately as it was obvious from the start that this relationship works.  Both of them have been 
                                    unfailingly kind to myself and everyone else as well as continue to show us how a relationship is supposed to work.
