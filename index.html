                        <h2>The Mike and Kori Story...</h2>
                        <p><b>The Meeting:</b>
                            Four simple words put us on the path to where we are today, "<i>Hey, how are you?</i>"
                            Mike saw this beautifully elegant woman and, with nothing else to go on, he mustered up the courage to use this remarkable pickup line.
                            After asking the question that Kori had told everyone was the one pickup line that no one should ever use, he lured her in with his impressive physique and boyish charm.
                            As they chatted, it was clear that something had clicked. Even after their first date at Tasca, they couldn't get enough of each other and decided to immediately follow dinner with a late night trip to see the Avengers.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p><b>The Proposal:</b> 
                            It was a quiet night on June 4, 2014. Kori had come home from class and Mike had prepared a delicious dinner. 
                            Contrary to common belief, this was not an immediate giveaway since Mike actually does cook on occasion, but I digress.
                            Anyway, at exactly 8pm as Kori sat on the couch with her dessert brownie, strange text messages flooded her phone: 
                            "I" from Myla, "Y" from Sarah, "H" from Claudia, "R" from Missy, "M" from Mike P, "A" and "R" from the Zac(k)s, "M" from Court and "!" from Halley.
                            By the time she decoded the message ("MARRY HIM!"), Mike was on his knee with the ring in hand and the "YES" came soon after. 
                            As cute as ever, Kori followed that up with a "Can I wear it?" to which Mike also replied with an ecstatic yes.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>The Life:</b> 
                            That pretty much describes it - we're living <i>the life</i>! From adventures around the world to nights in Boston or hanging out at our apartment, these past three years have been amazing.
                            We've been blessed to be able to share it with each other and with all of you, and we are looking forward to the exciting year ahead. We can't wait to celebrate with you all this September!!
                        </p>
